# Predicting aFRR Up-Regulation Energy Prices Using Weather, Demand-Side, and Spot Price Data
<br>
The Automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) market is one of the key balancing mechanisms in Europe. The system operators automatically conduct up-regulation or down-regulation to maintain the grid frequency every few seconds. Up-regulation occurs when demand is higher than expected or supply is lower than expected, while down-regulation occurs in the reverse circumstances. Among the key balancing indicators, the aFRR Up-regulation price, referring to the marginal price for upward balancing energy, captures the real-time scarcity of supply. The Up-regulation price responds to unpredictable weather conditions as well as demand-side factors, making it often volatile. 
<br>
The intention of this project is to model the Finnish aFRR Up-regulation price based on weather factors, such as cloud amount, wind speed, and precipitation, as well as demand-side factors such as electricity consumption and public holiday status. In addition to the weather and demand-side data, the day-ahead spot price is also included for training, acting as a market reference. Understanding how these variables influence real-time balancing prices provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of the balancing mechanism and supports forecasting for stakeholders.
