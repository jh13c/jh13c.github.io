</span>

<br>

<p style="max-width: 800px; font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.6rem;">
This project focuses on predicting Finnish aFRR up-regulation price through weather factors such as cloud amount, wind speed, precipitation as well as demand-side factors including electricity consumption. Machine learning models including Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random forest Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Regression are used to perform the prediction.
