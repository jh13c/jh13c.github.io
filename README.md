# Predicting Finnish aFRR Up-Regulation Price Using Weather and Demand-Side Data in the Electricity Market

<br>

This project focuses on predicting Finnish aFRR up-regulation price through weather factors such as cloud amount, wind speed, precipitation as well as demand-side factors including electricity consumption. Machine learning models including Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random forest Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron Regression are used to perform the prediction.
